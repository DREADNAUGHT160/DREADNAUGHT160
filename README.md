# **About Me**
I'm a Mechatronics graduate currently pursuing my Master's in AI Engineering of Autonomous Systems. I strongly believe that the future lies in the seamless integration of robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation, shaping a smarter and more efficient world.

üõ†Ô∏è On the tech side, I‚Äôm a self-taught Python programmer with a love for solving problems through code and exploring the limitless possibilities of AI. My focus is on developing smart, autonomous systems that can revolutionize industries and everyday life.

I‚Äôm always on the lookout for exciting projects, collaborations, and learning opportunities in AI, robotics, and Python development. Let‚Äôs create something innovative together!

#  What you hear, you may forget.
Listening to others can provide insight, but it‚Äôs easy for knowledge to slip away without action.

#  What you see, you remember.
Observing examples, projects, and demonstrations can help concepts stick, but seeing alone isn't enough for mastery.

#  What you do, you understand.
When you **dive in** and **take action**, you truly grasp the concepts. By **building**, **coding**, and **experimenting**, you unlock real understanding and gain experience that sticks with you.

### So take the plunge! 
Don‚Äôt just watch tutorials‚Äî**write the code**, **solve the problem**, and **build the project**. Every hands-on experience brings you closer to mastering AI, robotics, and Python development. Remember, the best way to learn is by **doing**!
